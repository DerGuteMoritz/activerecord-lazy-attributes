= activerecord-lazy-attributes

This ActiveRecord extension allows to define attributes to be
lazy-loaded. It's main purpose is to avoid loading large columns (such
as BLOBs) with every SELECT.

== Installation

  gem install activerecord-lazy-attributes

== Loading

To use it in a Rails application, add this line to your environment.rb (or similar):

  config.gem 'activerecord-lazy-attributes', :lib => 'lazy_attributes'

Otherwise:

  gem 'activerecord-lazy-attributes'
  require 'lazy_attributes'

== Example

  class Image < ActiveRecord::Base
    attr_lazy :data
  end

  i = Image.first # this selects all columns except "data"
  i.data # "data" column is selected separately

(the code here is the last contribution to this refactoring).

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
